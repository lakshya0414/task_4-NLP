    "corpus = [\"The historic Congress Party presidential election is over, and it is time to move on. On an individual level, I was pleased that my message of change and renewal resonated with many delegates, even if the final tally did not square with our hopes and expectations. As a political figure, I was delighted that this election gave me the opportunity to build a personal connection between Congress-minded voters across the country and myself. That the media took such an avid interest in the campaign was an added bonus, since it exposed so many members of the public to my ideals and values, and reminded them of the Congress party’s beliefs, policies and track record.\",\"In my previous column, I examined the vexed question of the role of Governors in our constitutional system, and the issue of their politicization. Are Governors meant to serve a political role, or be totally above politics? The controversies that have arisen over Union governments dismissing Governors appointed by previous central regimes, and over state governors clashing with the Opposition party-led state governments they supervise - seen notably in recent months in Kerala and earlier in West Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu - cry out for resolution. There are two alternatives. The first is to insulate the office of Governor from politicization altogether, by various measures that I suggest below. The second alternative is the more radical one: to abolish the post of Governor altogether, as a colonial relic that democratic India can dispense with. Except in the increasingly rare resort to President's rule, the Governor has little of substance to do, and his few substantive and mainly ceremonial tasks could easily be divided between the Chief Minister and the Chief Justice of the state. But that would mean depriving the ruling party - any ruling party -- in New Delhi of 29 comfortably-provisioned freebie positions to hand out to its loyal supporters, if Raj Bhavans cease to be useful job placement venues for the ruling party's apparatchiks -- and instruments of their political agenda.\",\"A couple of columns ago we discussed “unnecessary” words, taking a swipe at legalese in particular for piling word upon phrase to say the simplest things. There’s a particular term for the use of superfluous words: pleonasm, a term derived from a Greek word that means “excess”. A pleonasm uses two or more words, of which one is redundant, to express an idea. The classic example of a two-word pleonasm is “burning fire” (after all, a fire, by definitions, burns) and that of a whole pleonastic phrase is “I saw it with my own eyes”. If you saw it you had to have used your own eyes, right? The same holds true for “heard with my own ears” and “touched with my own hands” — you can’t touch with someone else’s hands or hear with someone else’s ears!\"]"

At a time when fears of a global recession are mounting, India seems likely to prove an exception to the worldwide tale of woe.

Estimates vary, but if one examines the World Bank’s numbers, India is estimated to grow at 6.6 per cent, compared with just 0.5 per cent for the US and 4.3 per cent for China (though from a much higher base) The good news may continue.

On an individual level, I was pleased that my message of change and renewal resonated with many delegates, even if the final tally did not square with our hopes and expectations. As a political figure, I was delighted that this election gave me the opportunity to build a personal connection between Congress-minded voters across the country and myself. That the media took such an avid interest in the campaign was an added bonus, since it exposed so many members of the public to my ideals and values, and reminded them of the Congress party’s beliefs, policies and track record. In my previous column, I examined the vexed question of the role of Governors in our constitutional system, and the issue of their politicization. Are Governors meant to serve a political role, or be totally above politics? The controversies that have arisen over Union governments dismissing Governors appointed by previous central regimes, and over state governors clashing with the Opposition party-led state governments they supervise - seen notably in recent months in Kerala and earlier in West Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu - cry out for resolution. There are two alternatives. The first is to insulate the office of Governor from politicization altogether, by various measures that I suggest below. The second alternative is the more radical one: to abolish the post of Governor altogether, as a colonial relic that democratic India can dispense with. Except in the increasingly rare resort to President's rule, the Governor has little of substance to do, and his few substantive and mainly ceremonial tasks could easily be divided between the Chief Minister and the Chief Justice of the state. But that would mean depriving the ruling party - any ruling party -- in New Delhi of 29 comfortably-provisioned freebie positions to hand out to its loyal supporters, if Raj Bhavans cease to be useful job placement venues for the ruling party's apparatchiks -- and instruments of their political agenda. A couple of columns ago we discussed “unnecessary” words, taking a swipe at legalese in particular for piling word upon phrase to say the simplest things. There’s a particular term for the use of superfluous words: pleonasm, a term derived from a Greek word that means “excess”. A pleonasm uses two or more words, of which one is redundant, to express an idea. The classic example of a two-word pleonasm is “burning fire” (after all, a fire, by definitions, burns) and that of a whole pleonastic phrase is “I saw it with my own eyes”. If you saw it you had to have used your own eyes, right? The same holds true for “heard with my own ears” and “touched with my own hands” — you can’t touch with someone else’s hands or hear with someone else’s ears!\"]).toarray(),vectorizer.transform([\"Most English-speakers think of English as an extraordinarily well-endowed language, equipped with words for every occasion and situation, if only one knew them. After all, English has an exhaustive vocabulary of more than 750,000 words. Yet there are numerous words in other languages to express ideas, concepts and emotions for which there is no English equivalent.As a speaker of Malayalam, the language of India’s Kerala state, I have been struck by some Malayalam terms for which there is no equivalent in English. Of these my favourite is ethramathe. Malayalis are hardly reputed as mathematical geniuses, but the coinage of this numerate word was an act of genius. Imagine you have to identify a person, an item or an object by their position in a long line of similar people, items or objects. You go to pick up a rental car, for instance, and are told you can collect it from a row of cars in a parking lot. In English you would have to ask “in which [number] position is my car parked?” to elicit the answer “it’s the ninth car in that row”. In Malayalam one word covers the idea — ethramathe. “Ethramathe vandi aane?” you ask, and your car is identified for you by its exact spot in numerical order.\"]).toarray())\n"
